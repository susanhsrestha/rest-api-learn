# Stores REST API

This is just a simple project I made when I started learning Python and Flask.


## Demo

You can navigate to this [link](https://rest-api-learn-gztd.onrender.com/docs/swagger) to view the demo and documentation of APIs.

It takes some time for the deployment to kick in. After about 10-15 seconds you can visit the [page](https://rest-api-learn-gztd.onrender.com/docs/swagger) again and it should work fine.
